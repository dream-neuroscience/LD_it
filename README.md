At the risk of sounding all pretentious...  
I was inspired for this project by Elon Musk and his iterative approach to building starships. Instead of getting everything right from the beginning, I will try to approach the lucid dream problem iteratively. As with the Starship project, the goal is clearly defined: To find a reliable way to induce lucid dreams.  
One iteration corresponds to one night within LD_it. Although it is a psychological phenomenon that is being investigated, I don't think that classical experimental approaches will lead to the goal. The reason is that the target phenomenon is not under conscious control. Often the exclusion of a placebo effect as a justification for the effects is scientifically central. In contrast, the problem here is more of an engineering problem. If the goal of reliable lucid dreaming is achieved, it is initially secondary whether a placebo effect is behind it. Another argument in favour of an iterative approach is that the approach cannot be clearly derived from previous Lucid Dreaming research, and therefore fast, flexible exploration seems more appropriate.
