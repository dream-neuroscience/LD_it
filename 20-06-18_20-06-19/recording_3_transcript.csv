3;I try to make a photo but know it will be difficult to hold the phone and press the camera trigger with the same hand;I will probably mess this up;nervous??
4;the animal is scared and flies away from my finger, but not far away. Eventually it disappears in a small stone crack within the building;this was to be expected, it is okay;
